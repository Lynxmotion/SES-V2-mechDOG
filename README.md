RobotShop Purchase: [Lynxmotion (LSS) - mechDOG Quadruped RC Kit w/ LSS-2IO](https://www.robotshop.com/en/lynxmotion-lss-mechdog-quadruped-rc-kit-w-lss-2io.html)

Initial project made by Mech-Dickel Robotics with the Lynxmotion BETA servos.<br>

- [mechDOG (robot dog based on Arduino and LSS)](https://www.robotshop.com/community/forum/t/mechdog-robot-dog-based-on-arduino-and-lss/65705)


Project then evolved to a Lynxmotion base frame/platform and Dickel wrote the code for it as well as provide essential feedback for that new platform.

Project is available on RobotShop / Lynxmotion forum

Then Eduardo Nunes ([EduardoFNA](https://github.com/EduardoFNA)) & Geraldine Barreto ([geraldinebc](https://github.com/geraldinebc)) joined the project for an Inverse Kinematics sample code.
