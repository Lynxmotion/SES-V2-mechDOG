Initial project made by Mech-Dickel ([mechdickel](https://github.com/mechdickel)) Robotics with the Lynxmotion BETA servos.<br>
- [mechDOG (robot dog based on Arduino and LSS)](https://www.robotshop.com/community/forum/t/mechdog-robot-dog-based-on-arduino-and-lss/65705)

Project then evolved to a Lynxmotion base frame/platform and Dickel wrote the code for it as well as provide essential feedback for that new platform.

Project is available on RobotShop / Lynxmotion forum
- [Lynxmotion SES V2 mechDOG Quadrapod Robot](https://www.robotshop.com/community/forum/t/lynxmotion-ses-v2-mechdog-quadrapod-robot/78217)

Then Eduardo Nunes ([EduardoFNA](https://github.com/EduardoFNA)) & Geraldine Barreto ([geraldinebc](https://github.com/geraldinebc)) joined the project for an Inverse Kinematics sample code.
